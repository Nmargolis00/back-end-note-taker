# Back End Note Taker

## Description

This project helped me to think through how to approach a problem and build it out with JavaScript. I utilized following the data flow between the client and server which included fetch, api calls and routing the information. I was able to store and modify the data in the database. This was helpful to understand API Get, Post and Delete methods and how it affects the database
